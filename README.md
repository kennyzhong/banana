This is just a project being worked on, I figured the "tech" that is running it might be useful to other people. I know I found it hard to start with just getting a simple opengl sprite renderer up and running when I had very little knowledge of it, so here is my interpretation of it. There is many many bugs, it might not even work, it could be the most inefficient work yet, it could be utter shit... But it's my utter shit. Oh and possibly your utter shit if you want to use it. 

It requires SDL2-2.0.4 and glew, but the versions used are in the deps folder and are also linked to in the project file, relative to the solution folder so this should work on your machine. A linux version of this will come somewen, I just have to find the motivation to do so.

A lot of the features here are just there because I needed them at some point, none of them are full fleshed out.
